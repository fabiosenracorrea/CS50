# GoFinance

GoFinance is an application designed to track your financial transactions!

You can check the application out [here](https://github.com/fabiosenracorrea/goFinance)

You can register for an account to have your own dashboard and start monitoring your transactions, saving them with a Title, it's value, it's type (income | outcome) and category. If you feel like registering old transactions you might have been keeping track of using excel, you can upload a CSV file with all the transactions and the application will load and display them to you on a clean Dashboard.

And even if you've uploaded some incorrect transaction, you can easily delete it from your account. And don't worry about making debts, the application will not let you create an outcome transaction with a value higher than your current balance. Stay financially save guys :)
