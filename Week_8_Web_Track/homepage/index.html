                            <p>
                                Graduated as a Chemical Engineer, Fábio found his passion in computer science and
                                created this page to share every project along the way of becoming a top performer as a software developer.
                            </p>

                        <article>
                            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
                            <p>
                                Born in May 27th, 1995, Fábio has lived his whole life in Belo Horizonte/MG, Brazil, where he studied at Marista Dom Silvério, a traditional school of the city. Right after high school, he decided to start a graduation on Chemical Engineering, on one of the country's most illustrious universities: UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                During his graduation, Fábio had the opportunity of avoiding the usual "Technical only" formation and further developing his personal skills, working as a salesman specialist on two separate occasions, both directly in contact with every leading figure and CEO of the companies. He proudly achieved 7 company's revenue generation records such as daily, weekly, monthly and all time highest values and stablished a new way of dealing with leads. In a startup growing 100+% each month, he was responsible for generating more than R$ 100.000,00 in revenue and held 13% of all company's income during the working period.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                While setting records and becoming a top-performer in the field, Fábio completed his graduation as a Chemical Engineer and decided to learn how to code to automate regular tasks, but, in the end, fell in love with everything tech-related and could not bear the idea of not working with that. He decided, then, to drop out of sales and is now attending a 1-year full-stack course, to better understand and work on the field.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                This website was created in order to share Fábio's most relevant projects and ideas, while also listing relevant stuff about the field.
