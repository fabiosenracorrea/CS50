## This is the CS50! Week 0

On this directory, the exercises of Week 0 are covered.

### What was week 0 all about?

Week 0 covers some basic understanding on CS behind the scenes, talking a little bit about bits (no pun intended) and algorithm logic.

It also covers MIT's graphical programming language, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all).

### What was the exercise here?

Here is the complete description of what should be done:

It’s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivy’s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

You might find these [tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) or [starter projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/starter-projects) helpful. And you’re welcome to explore [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) for inspiration. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don’t try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: pluck off one piece at a time. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth. And select File > Save now every few minutes so that you don’t lose any work!

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won’t find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements.
